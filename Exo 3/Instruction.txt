We are supermarket sellers and we don't have a smart cashier to use, so we have to create one.
We have 3 products to sell with the prices shown below:

Product	    Price	Unit
Apple	    32	kg
Light	    15	year
Starship	999.99	piece

Our precious clients can buy any amount of any product. They have an infinite shopping basket.
When the client finishes shopping, he/she puts his/her basket to the cashier, which calculates the total price of the products in the basket.
